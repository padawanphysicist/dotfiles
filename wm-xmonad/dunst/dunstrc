# Keyboard shortcuts
#
# Idle thresholds can be set letting the notification stay onscreen if the user
# is idle longer than the threshold. The shortcuts are important so we can
# change a bit the behavior of the notification.
#
# Shortcuts are specified as =[modifier+][modifier+]...key=. The available
# modifiers are: =ctrl=, =mod1= (=alt= key), =mod2=, =mod3= and =mod4= (=win=
# key). The section is structured in the configuration as follows:
[shortcuts]
    # For more info about the available actions, see the configuration example
    # at https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/blob/master/dunstrc
    #

    # Geometry of the window

    # The geometry of the message window. It is defined as follows:
    #
    # [{width}]x{height}[+/-{x}+/-{y}]
    #
    # The height is measured in number of notifications everything else in
    # pixels. If the width is omitted but the height is given ("-geometry x2"),
    # the message window expands over the whole screen (dmenu-like). If width is
    # 0, the window expands to the longest message displayed. A positive x is
    # measured from the left, a negative from the right side of the screen. Y is
    # measured from the top and down respectively.
    #
    # The width can be negative. In this case the actual width is the screen
    # width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

    # - strip :: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #   clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the server.
    #   Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is simplistic so
    #   using this option outside of matching rules for specific applications
    #   *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    # - no :: Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #   plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
    #   capability if this is set as a global setting.
